# E05b-Physics
Finished assignment. This was pretty difficult, so I didn't get to the extra credit. Creating gravity wasn't as bad as I though it would be. These past couple of assignments have been very helpful. Seeing the comments as to what actions are performed on specific lines also helps alot!
